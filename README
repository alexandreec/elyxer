eLyXer -- convert LyX source files to HTML output.

Introduction
============
eLyXer converts a LyX source file to a HTML page. Full documentation in HTML
format can be found at docs/index.html.

Installation
============
Quick installation guide (for the impatient):
* download the latest version from http://www.nongnu.org/elyxer/,
* decompress the .zip or .tar.gz
* and install it using the provided script install.py as root:
    # ./install.py
  or on Windows:
    > python install.py

To install eLyXer first download a compressed version from
  http://www.nongnu.org/elyxer/
You will also need a recent (> 2.4) version of Python on your target machine.

For decompression: open a terminal window in the directory that contains the
downloaded file and just write at the command line prompt:
  $ tar -xzf elyxer-[version].tar.gz
Or for the .zip version:
  $ unzip elyxer-[version].zip
where [version] should be something like 0.44; the full name might be something
like elyxer-0.44.tar.gz.

On Windows or Mac OS X you can unzip the file using the graphical tool of your
choice. In any case, a directory called elyxer-[version] should appear, where
the installer script install.py can be found (along with this README).

The recommended installation procedure is to just run this script. On Linux type as
root:
  # ./install.py
and similarly for Mac OS X, while for Windows:
  > python install.py
Note the you don't need to write the prompt, # or >; it appears on the console.

Double-clicking on install.py should also work if your Python installation is
minimally sane. It will tell you as a result if it has installed Python as a
module, which should be the typical result; in this case eLyXer should be run
as a module:
  $ python -m elyxer [input file] [output file]

For ancient Python 2.3 the script will install Python as a binary, which is not
recommended. In this case eLyXer is run like this:
  $ elyxer.py [input file] [output file]

An alternative installation procedure is to copy elyxer.py manually to a
directory included in the execution path. On Linux type as root:
  # cp elyxer.py /usr/bin/
or on Windows as any user:
  > copy elyxer.py c:\windows\
and on Mac OS X as an admin user:
  % sudo cp elyxer.py /usr/local/bin/

You can also put elyxer.py on any other directory in your path, like ~/bin,
or even use an absolute path:
  $ /home/pepito/software/elyxer.py
or, on Windows:
  > c:\my documents\software\elyxer.py

To install the eLyXer Python package using Python distutils just write as
root:
  # python setup.py install
or, on Windows:
  > python setup.py install
and on Mac OS X:
  % sudo python setup.py install
This will ensure that any Python packages trying to access eLyXer will find
it.

LyX Integration
===============

To integrate eLyXer with LyX you just have to reconfigure LyX, selecting
Tools -> Reconfigure from within LyX. For rather old versions of LyX (< 1.6.2)
you may have to copy elyxer.py into the LyX directory, and reconfigure it.
Later versions will recognize eLyXer automatically, either if you install it
using distutils (as a module) or as a binary.

Usage
=====
eLyXer can be invoked from the command line as:
  $ python -m elyxer [source file] [destination file]
or, if it was installed as a binary:
  $ elyxer.py [source file] [destination file]

If the source file is omitted then STDIN is used; likewise, if no destination
file is specified eLyXer will output to STDOUT. This allows its use in pipes
and other flexible configurations.

Examples:
  $ python -m elyxer file.lyx file.html
converts file.lyx to file.html. Debug messages are shown.
  $ cat file.lyx | python -m elyxer > file.html
converts file.lyx to file.html, as before. This time debug messages are not
shown.
  $ python -m elyxer file.lyx | grep "<blockquote>" | wc
counts all blockquote paragraphs.
  $ python -m elyxer file.lyx | wget --no-check-certificate --spider -nv -F -i -
checks all external links in a document recursively. (Local links will appear
as unresolved, but they can be ignored.)
