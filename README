eLyXer -- convert LyX source files to HTML output.

Copyright (C) 2009 Alex FernÃ¡ndez (elyxer@gmail.com)

Introduction
============
eLyXer converts a LyX source file to a HTML page.

Installation
============
To install eLyXer download a distributed file from
http://www.nongnu.org/elyxer/, open a terminal window in the directory that
contains this file and just write at the command line prompt:
  $ tar -xzf elyxer-[version].tar.gz
Or for the .zip version:
  $ unzip elyxer-[version].zip
On Windows or Mac OS X you can unzip the file using the graphical tool of your
choice. In any case, a directory called elyxer should appear, where the main
file elyxer.py can be found. This file can be copied to a directory included
in the execution path. On Linux type as root:
  # cp elyxer.py /usr/bin/
or on Windows as any user:
  > copy elyxer.py c:\windows\
and on Mac OS X as an admin user:
  % sudo cp elyxer.py /usr/local/bin/

You can also put elyxer.py on any other directory in your path, like ~/bin,
or even use an absolute path:
  $ /home/pepito/software/elyxer.py
or, on Windows:
  > c:\my documents\software\elyxer.py

To install the eLyXer Python package using Python distutils just write as
root:
  # python setup.py install
or, on Windows:
  > python setup.py install
and on Mac OS X:
  % sudo python setup.py install
This will ensure that any Python packages trying to access eLyXer will find
it.

LyX Integration
===============

To integrate eLyXer with LyX you have to copy elyxer.py into the LyX
directory, and reconfigure it. Later versions may recognize eLyXer
automatically if you install it using distutils.

Usage
=====
eLyXer can be invoked from the command line as:
  $ elyxer.py [source file] [destination file]

If the source file is omitted then STDIN is used; likewise, if no destination
file is specified eLyXer will output to STDOUT. This allows its use in pipes
and other flexible configurations.

Examples:
  $ elyxer.py file.lyx file.html
converts file.lyx to file.html. Debug messages are shown.
  $ cat file.lyx | elyxer > file.html
converts file.lyx to file.html, as before. This time debug messages are not
shown.
  $ elyxer.py file.lyx | grep "<blockquote>" | wc
counts all blockquote paragraphs.
  $ elyxer.py file.lyx | wget --no-check-certificate --spider -nv -F -i -
checks all external links in a document recursively. (Local links will appear
as unresolved, but they can be ignored.)
