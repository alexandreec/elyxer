eLyXer -- convert LyX source files to HTML output.

Copyright (C) 2009 Alex FernÃ¡ndez (elyxer@gmail.com)

Introduction
============
eLyXer converts a LyX source file to a HTML page.

Usage
=====
eLyXer can be invoked from the command line as:
  $ elyxer [source file] [destination file]

If the source file is omitted then STDIN is used; likewise, if no destination
file is specified eLyXer will output to STDOUT. This allows its use in pipes
and other flexible configurations.

Examples:
  $ elyxer file.lyx file.html
converts file.lyx to file.html. Debug messages are shown.
  $ cat file.lyx | elyxer > file.html
converts file.lyx to file.html, as before. This time debug messages are not
shown.
  $ elyxer file.lyx | grep "<blockquote>" | wc
counts all blockquote paragraphs.
  $ elyxer file.lyx | wget --no-check-certificate --spider -nv -F -i -
checks all external links in a document recursively. (Local links will appear
as unresolved, but they can be ignored.)
