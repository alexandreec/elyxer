eLyXer -- convert LyX source files to HTML output.

Copyright (C) 2009 Alex Fernández

Introduction
============
eLyXer converts a LyX source file to a HTML page.

Usage
=====
eLyXer can be invoked from the command line as:
  $ elyxer.py [source file] [destination file]

If the source file is omitted then STDIN is used; likewise, if no destination
file is specified eLyXer will output to STDOUT. This allows its use in pipes
and other flexible configurations.

Examples:
  $ elyxer.py file.lyx file.html
converts file.lyx to file.html. Debug messages are shown.
  $ cat file.lyx | elyxer.py > file.html
converts file.lyx to file.html, as before. This time debug messages are not
shown.
  $ elyxer.py file.lyx | grep "<blockquote>" | wc
counts all blockquote paragraphs.

Documentation
=============
Documentation about eLyXer, including a user guide and a developer guide, can
be found in the docs directory.
