\begin_layout Section
The Basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document should help you get started if you want to understand how
 eLyXer works, and maybe extending its functionality.
 The package (including this guide and all accompanying materials) is licensed
 under the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "GPL version 3"
target "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html"

\end_inset

 or, at your option, any later version.

\family default
 file for details.
 Also visit the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "main page"
target "index.html"

\end_inset

 to find out about the latest developments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this first section we will outline how eLyXer performs the basic tasks.
 Next section will be devoted to more arcane matters.
 The third section deals with future planned extensions, and the fourth
 one includes things that will probably 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 be implemented.
 Finally there is a FAQ that contains answers to questions asked privately
 and on the lyx-devel list

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting eLyXer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are interested in eLyXer from a developer perspective the first thing
 to do is fetch the code.
 It is included in the standard distribution, so just navigate to the 
\family typewriter
src/
\family default
 folder and take a look at the 
\family typewriter
.py
\family default
 Python code files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more serious use, or if your distribution did not carry the source code,
 or perhaps to get the latest copy of the code: you need to install the
 tool 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
, created by Linus Torvalds (of Linux fame) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "git-download"

\end_inset

.
 You will also need to have Python installed; versions at or above 2.4 should
 be fine 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "python-download"

\end_inset

.
 The code is hosted in Savannah 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "savannah-elyxer"

\end_inset

, a GNU project for hosting non-GNU projects.
 So first you have to fetch the code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\color blue
$
\color inherit
 git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/elyxer.git
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should see some output similar to this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/user/install/elyxer/.git/
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
remote: Counting objects: 528, done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (157/157), done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
remote: Total 528 (delta 371), reused 528 (delta 371)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Receiving objects: 100% (528/528), 150.00 KiB | 140 KiB/s, done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Resolving deltas: 100% (371/371), done.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now enter the directory that 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
 has created.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\color blue
$
\color inherit
 cd elyxer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your first task is to create the main executable file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\color blue
$
\color inherit
 ./make
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The build system for eLyXer will compile it for you, and even run some basic
 tests.
 Now you can try it out:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\color blue
$
\color inherit
 cd docs/
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\color blue
$
\color inherit
 ../elyxer.py devguide.lyx devguide2.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have just created your first eLyXer page! The result is in 
\family typewriter
devguide2.html
\family default
; to view it in Firefox:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\color blue
$
\color inherit
 firefox-bin devguide2.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note for Windows developers: on Windows eLyXer needs to be invoked using
 the Python executable, and of course changing the slashes to backward-slashes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\color blue
>
\color inherit
 Python ..
\backslash
elyxer.py devguide.lyx devguide2.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the rest of this section we will delve a little bit into how eLyXer works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\family typewriter
Container
\family default
s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic code artifact (or `class' in Python talk) is the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
, located in the 
\family typewriter
gen
\family default
 package.
 Its responsibility is to take a bit of LyX code and generate working HTML
 code.
 This includes (with the aid of some helper classes): reading from file
 a few lines, converting it to HTML, and writing the lines back to a second
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Container-structure"

\end_inset

 shows how a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 works.
 Each type of 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 should have a 
\family typewriter
parser
\family default
 and an 
\family typewriter
output
\family default
, and a list of 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
.
 The 
\family typewriter
parser
\family default
 object receives LyX input and produces a list of 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
 that is stored in the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
.
 The 
\family typewriter
output
\family default
 object then converts those 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
 to a portion of valid HTML code.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two important class attributes of a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
start
\family default
: a string of text containing the LyX command that we are about to process;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and 
\family typewriter
ending
\family default
, which is used on some 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
s to determine when to stop parsing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A class called 
\family typewriter
ContainerFactory
\family default
 has the responsibility of creating the appropriate containers, as the strings
 in their 
\family typewriter
start
\family default
 attributes are found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic method of a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
process()
\family default
: called after parsing the LyX text and before outputting the HTML result.
 Here the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 can alter its 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
 as needed, once everything has been read and before it is output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we will see each subordinate class in detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The package 
\family typewriter
parse
\family default
 contains almost all parsing code; it has been isolated on purpose so that
 LyX format changes can be tackled just by changing the code in that directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
 has two main methods: 
\family typewriter
parseheader()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
parse()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
parseheader()
\family default
: parses the first line and returns the contents as a list of words.
 This method is common for all 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
s.
 For example, for the command 
\family typewriter
'
\backslash

\backslash
emph on'
\family default
 the 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
 will return a list 
\family typewriter
['
\backslash

\backslash
emph','on']
\family default
.
 This list will end up in the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 as an attribute 
\family typewriter
header
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
parse()
\family default
: parses all the remaining lines of the command.
 They will end up in the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 as an attribute 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
.
 This method depends on the particular 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
 employed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basic 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
s reside in the file 
\family typewriter
parser.py
\family default
.
 Among them are the following usual classes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
LoneCommand
\family default
: parses a single line containing a LyX command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
BoundedParser
\family default
: reads until it finds the 
\family typewriter
ending
\family default
.
 For each line found within, the 
\family typewriter
BoundedParser
\family default
 will call the 
\family typewriter
ContainerFactory
\family default
 to recursively parse its contents.
 The parser then returns everything found inside as a list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Outputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Common outputs reside in 
\family typewriter
output.py
\family default
.
 They have just one method:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
gethtml()
\family default
: processes the contents of a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 and returns a list with file lines.
 Carriage returns 
\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
 must be added manually at the desired points; eLyXer will just merge all
 lines and write them to file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outputs do not however inherit from a common class; all you need is an object
 with a method 
\family typewriter
gethtml(self,container)
\family default
 that processes the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
's 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
 (as a list attribute).
 An output can also use all attributes of a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 to do their job.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tutorial: Adding Your Own 
\family typewriter
Container
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to add your own 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 to the processing you do not need to modify all these files.
 You just need to create your own source file that includes the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
, the 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
 and the 
\family typewriter
output
\family default
 (or reuse existing ones).
 Once it is added to the 
\family typewriter
types
\family default
 in the 
\family typewriter
ContainerFactory
\family default
 eLyXer will happily start matching it against LyX commands as they are
 parsed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are good examples of parsing commands in just one file in 
\family typewriter
image.py
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
formula.py
\family default
.
 But let us build our own container 
\family typewriter
BibitemInset
\family default
 here.
 We want to parse the LyX command in listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:bibitem-command"

\end_inset

.
 In the resulting HTML we will generate an anchor: a single tag 
\family typewriter
<a name="mykey">
\family default
 with fixed text 
\family typewriter
"[ref]"
\family default
.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will call the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 
\family typewriter
BibitemInset
\family default
, and it will process precisely the inset that we have here.
 We will place the class in 
\family typewriter
bibitem.py
\family default
.
 So this file starts as shown in listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:bibitem-class"

\end_inset

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can use the parser for a bounded command with start and ending, 
\family typewriter
BoundedParser
\family default
.
 For the output we will generate a single HTML tag 
\family typewriter
<a>
\family default
, so the 
\family typewriter
TagOutput()
\family default
 is appropriate.
 Finally we will set the 
\family typewriter
breaklines
\family default
 attribute to 
\family typewriter
False
\family default
, so that the output shows the tag in the same line as the contents: 
\family typewriter
<a \SpecialChar \ldots{}
>[ref]</a>
\family default
.
 Listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
BoundedParser
\family default
 will automatically parse the header and the contents.
 In the 
\family typewriter
process()
\family default
 method we will discard the first line with the 
\family typewriter
LatexCommand
\family default
, and place the key from the second line as link destination.
 The class 
\family typewriter
StringContainer
\family default
 holds string constants; in our case we will have to isolate the key by
 splitting the string around the double quote 
\family typewriter
"
\family default
, and then access the anchor with the same name.
 The contents will be set to the fixed string 
\family typewriter
[ref]
\family default

\begin_layout Standard
Now this 
\series bold
Container
\series default
 is not too refined: the link text is fixed, and we need to do additional
 processing on the bibitem entry to show consecutive numbers.
 The approach is not very flexible either: e.g.
 anchor text is fixed.
 But in less than 20 lines we have parsed a new LyX command and have outputted
 valid, working XHTML code.
 The actual code is a bit different but follows the same principles; it
 can be found in 
\family typewriter
src/link.py
\family default
: in the classes 
\family typewriter
BiblioCite
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
BiblioEntry
\family default
, and it processes bibliography entries and citations (with all our missing
 bits) in about 50 lines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Advanced Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section tackles other, more complex features; all of them are included
 in current versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parse Tree
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Parse-Tree"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On initialization of the 
\family typewriter
ContainerFactory
\family default
, a 
\family typewriter
ParseTree
\family default
 is created to quickly pass each incoming LyX command to the appropriate
 containers, which are created on demand.
 For example, when the 
\family typewriter
ContainerFactory
\family default
 finds a command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter

\backslash

\backslash
emph on
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
it will create and initialize an 
\family typewriter
EmphaticText
\family default
 object.
 The 
\family typewriter
ParseTree
\family default
 works with words: it creates a tree where each keyword has its own node.
 At that node there may be a leaf, which is a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 class, and/or additional branches that point to other nodes.
 If the tree finds a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 leaf at the last node then it has found the right point; otherwise it must
 backtrack to the last node with a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 leaf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:parsetree"

\end_inset

 shows a piece of the actual parse tree.
 You can see how if the string to parse is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\backslash
begin_inset LatexCommand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, at the node for the second keyword 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LatexCommand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 there is no 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 leaf, just two more branches 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

label
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ref
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this case the 
\family typewriter
ParseTree
\family default
 would backtrack to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

begin_inset
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and choose the generic 
\family typewriter
Inset
\family default
.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parsing is much faster this way, but there are disadvantages; for one, parsing
 can only be done using whole words and not prefixes.
 SGML tags (such as 
\family typewriter
<lyxtabular>
\family default
) pose particular problems: sometimes they may appear with attributes (as
 in 
\family typewriter
<lyxtabular version="3">
\family default
), and in this case the starting word is 
\family typewriter
<lyxtabular
\family default
 without the trailing 
\family typewriter
'>'
\family default
 character.
 So the parse tree removes any trailing 
\family typewriter
'>'
\family default
, and the start string would be just 
\family typewriter
<lyxtabular
\family default
; this way both starting words 
\family typewriter
<lyxtabular>
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
<lyxtabular
\family default
 are recognized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Postprocessors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some post-processing of the resulting HTML page can make the results look
 much better.
 The main stage in the postprocessing pipeline inserts a title 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bibliography
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before the first bibliographical entry.
 But more can be added to alter the result.
 As eLyXer parses a LyX document it automatically numbers all chapters and
 sections.
 This is also done in the postprocessor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The package 
\family typewriter
post
\family default
 contains most postprocessing code, although some postprocessors are located
 in the classes of their containers for easy access.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Postprocessors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some post-processing of the resulting HTML page can make the results look
 much better.
 The main stage in the postprocessing pipeline inserts a title 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bibliography
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before the first bibliographical entry.
 But more can be added to alter the result.
 As eLyXer parses a LyX document it automatically numbers all chapters and
 sections.
 This is also done in the postprocessor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a 
\family typewriter
LastStage
\family default
: a stage that processes the 
\emph on
last
\emph default
 container based on the current one.
 It is used to join list items into one coherent list tag.
 The principle is the same as with other postprocessors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Baskets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formulae in LyX are rendered beautifully into TeX and PDF documents.
 For HTML the conversion is not so simple.
 There are basically three options:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
render the formula as an image (GIF or PNG), then import the image;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
export a specific language called MathML
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
or render using a variety of Unicode characters, HTML and CSS wizardry 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "white-math"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer employs the third technique, with varied results.
 Basic fractions and square roots should be rendered fine, albeit at the
 moment there may be some issues pending.
 Complex fractions with several levels do not come out right.
 (But see subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:MathML"

\end_inset

.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will notice that in the 
\family typewriter
src/
\family default
 folder there are several Python files, while in the main directory there
 is just a big one.
 The reason is that before distributing the source code is coalesced and
 placed on the main directory, so that users can run it without worrying
 about libraries, directories and the such.
 (They need of course to have Python 2.5 installed.) And the weapon is a little
 Python script called 
\family typewriter
coalesce.py
\family default
 that does the dirty job of parsing dependencies and inserting them into
 the main file.
 There is also a 
\family typewriter
make
\family default
 Bash script that takes care of permissions and generates the documentation.
 Just type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 ./make
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
at the prompt.
 It is a primitive way perhaps to generate the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

binary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (ok, not really a binary but a distributable Python file), but it works
 great.
 It also runs all of the included tests to check that no functionality has
 been lost from one release to the next -- although some issues in a feature
 can slip undetected if there is no test for them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the moment there is no way to do this packaging on non-Unix operating
 systems with a single script, e.g.
 a Windows 
\family typewriter
.bat
\family default
 script.
 However the steps themselves are trivial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
License and Contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer is published under the GPL, version 3 or later 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "stallman-gplv3"

\end_inset

.
 This basically means that you can modify the code and distribute the result
 as desired, as long as you publish your modifications under the same license.
 But consult a lawyer if you want an authoritative opinion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All contributions will be published under this same license, so if you send
 them this way you implicitly give your consent.
 An explicit license grant would be even better and may be required for
 larger contributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Future Extensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author has plans for the following extensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Templates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some header and footer content is automatically added to the resulting document.
 The use of templates might make the job far more flexible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Page Segmentors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A page segmentor should build a set of pages and cross-reference them, but
 generally avoids the complexities of the internal structure.
 The tool is called 
\family typewriter
idxer
\family default
.
 It uses templates to construct the header and footer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complete package should implement something like the flow in figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:pipeline"

\end_inset

.
 This is the high-level design that has to be filled in with the missing
 tool.

\begin_layout Subsection
MathML
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:MathML"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As suggested by GÃ¼nther Milne and Abdelrazak Younes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "milde-mathml,younes-elyxer"

\end_inset

, MathML is by now well supported in Firefox.
 An option to emit MathML (instead of more-or-less clumsy HTML and CSS code)
 could be very useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Roadmap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basic tool support is ready by Q1 2009 (end of March), including support
 for most common LyX documents.
 In Q2 2009 (i.e.
 by the end of June) the pipeline should be complete and running.
 LyX integration (as an external tool) is planned for Q3 2009.
 All this within the usual constraints: day job, family, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discarded Bits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not everything that has been planned or can be done with eLyXer is planned;
 some extensions have been discarded.
 However, this means basically that the author is too ignorant to know how
 to do them right; help (and patches!) towards a sane implementation would
 be welcome if they fit with the design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spellchecking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX can use a spellchecker to verify the words used.
 However it is not interactive so you may forget to run it before generating
 a version.
 It is possible to integrate eLyXer with a spellchecker and verify the spelling
 before generating the HTML, but it is not clear that it can be done cleanly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
URL Checking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another fun possibility is to make eLyXer check all the external URLs embedded
 in the document.
 However the Python facilities for URL checking are not very mature, at
 least with Python 2.5: some of them do not return errors, others throw complex
 exceptions that have to be parsed\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 It is far easier to just create the HTML
 page and use wget (or a similar tool) to recursively check all links in
 the page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Use of 
\family typewriter
lyx2lyx
\family default
 Framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Abdelrazak Younes suggests using the 
\family typewriter
lyx2lyx
\family default
 framework, which after all already knows about LyX formats 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "younes-elyxer"

\end_inset

.
 It is an interesting suggestion, but one that for now does not fit well
 with the design of eLyXer: a standalone tool to convert between two formats,
 or as Kernighan and Plauger put it, a standalone 
\emph on
filter
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kernighan-filters"

\end_inset

.
 Long-term maintenance might result a bit heavier with this approach though,
 especially if LyX changes to a different file format in the future.

\begin_layout Section
FAQ
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: I don't like how your tool outputs my document, what can I do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: First make sure that you are using the proper CSS file, i.e.
 copy the existing 
\family typewriter
docs/lyx.css
\family default
 file to your web page directory.
 Next try to customize the CSS file to your liking; it is a flexible approach
 that requires no code changes.
 Then try changing the code (and submitting the patch back).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Why does your Python code suck so much? You don't make proper use of
 most features!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: Because I'm mostly a novice with little Python culture.
 If you want to help it suck less, please send mail and enlighten me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: How is the code maintained?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: It is kept in a 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
 repository.
 Patches in 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
 format are welcome (but keep in mind that my knowledge of 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
 is even shallower than my Python skills).
