\begin_layout Title
eLyXer Programming Guide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Alex Fern√°ndez (elyxer@gmail.com)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document should help you get started extending eLyXer.
 In this section we will outline eLyXer performs its basic tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\family typewriter
Container
\family default
s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Container-structure"

\end_inset

 should explain how a Container works.
 A 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 should have a 
\family typewriter
parser
\family default
 and an 
\family typewriter
output
\family default
, and a list of 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
.
 The 
\family typewriter
parser
\family default
 object receives LyX input and produces a list of 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
 that is stored in the Container.
 The 
\family typewriter
output
\family default
 object then converts that 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
 to a portion of valid HTML code.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand label

\end_inset

Container structure.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two important class attributes of a Container are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
start
\family default
: a string of text containing the LyX command that we are about to process;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and 
\family typewriter
ending
\family default
, which is used on some 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
s to determine when to stop parsing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A ParseTree is created on initialization to quickly pass each incoming LyX
 command to the appropriate containers, which are created on demand.
 For example, when the 
\family typewriter
ContainerFactory
\family default
 finds a command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter

\backslash

\backslash
emph on
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
it will create and initialize an 
\family typewriter
EmphaticText
\family default
 object.
 Parsing is much faster this way, but there are disadvantages; for one,
 parsing can only be done using whole words and not suffixes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
 has two main methods: 
\family typewriter
parseheader()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
parse()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
parseheader()
\family default
: parses the first line and returns the contents as a list of words.
 This method is common for all 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
s.
 For example, for the command 
\family typewriter
'
\backslash

\backslash
emph on'
\family default
 the 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
 will return a list 
\family typewriter
['
\backslash

\backslash
emph','on']
\family default
.
 This list will end up in the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 as an attribute 
\family typewriter
header
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
parse()
\family default
: parses all the remaining lines of the command.
 They will end up in the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 as an attribute 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
.
 This method depends on the particular 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
 employed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
s reside in the file 
\family typewriter
parse.py
\family default
.
 Among them are the following usual classes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
LoneCommand
\family default
: parses a single line containing a LyX command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
BoundedParser
\family default
: reads until it finds the 
\family typewriter
ending
\family default
.
 For each line found inside, the 
\family typewriter
BoundedParser
\family default
 will call the 
\family typewriter
ContainerFactory
\family default
 to recursively parse its contents.
 Then the parser returns everything found inside as a list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Outputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Common outputs reside in 
\family typewriter
output.py
\family default
.
 They have just one method:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
gethtml()
\family default
: processes the contents of a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 and returns a list with file lines.
 Carriage returns 
\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
 must be added manually at the desired points; eLyXer will just merge all
 lines and write them to file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outputs do not however inherit from a common class; all you need is an object
 with a method 
\family typewriter
gethtml(self,container)
\family default
 that processes the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
's 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
 list attribute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Preprocessors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file 
\family typewriter
preprocessor.py
\family default
 contains some preprocessing to be done on 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
s before they are output.
 Preprocessing is deactivated at the time since it needs some context, not
 just the current 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adding your own 
\family typewriter
Container
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to add your own 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 to the processing you do not need to modify all these files.
 You just need to create your own source file that includes the 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
, the 
\family typewriter
Parser
\family default
 and the 
\family typewriter
output
\family default
.
 Once it is added to the 
\family typewriter
ContainerFactory
\family default
 eLyXer will happily start matching it against LyX commands as they are
 parsed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The files 
\family typewriter
formula.py
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
image.py
\family default
 have some examples of processing a command in just one file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Advanced Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section tackles other, more complex features.
 Not all of them are included in the current version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Node Numbering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As eLyXer parses a LyX document it automatically numbers all chapters and
 sections.
 The code is, however, not ready yet for prime time and has been disabled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Mathematical Formulae
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formulae in LyX are rendered beautifully into TeX and PDF documents.
 For HTML the conversion is not so simple.
 There are basically three options:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
render the formula as an image (GIF or PNG), then import the image;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
export a specific language called MathML
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
or render using a variety of Unicode characters, HTML and CSS wizardry 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "white-math"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer employs the third technique, with varied results.
 Basic fractions and square roots should be rendered fine, albeit at the
 moment there may be some issues pending.
 Complex fractions with several levels do not come out right.
 (But see subsection 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:MathML"

\end_inset

.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will notice that in the 
\family typewriter
src/
\family default
 folder there are several Python files, while in the main directory there
 is just a big one.
 The reason is that before distributing the source code is conflated and
 placed on the main directory, so that users can run it without worrying
 about libraries, directories and the such.
 (They need of course to have Python 2.5 installed.) And the weapon is a little
 Python script called 
\family typewriter
conflate.py
\family default
 that does the dirty job of parsing dependencies and inserting them into
 the main file.
 There is also a 
\family typewriter
make
\family default
 Bash script that takes care of permissions and generates the documentation.
 Just type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
$ ./make
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
at the prompt.
 It is a primitive way perhaps to generate the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

binary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (ok, not really a binary but a distributable Python file), but it works
 great.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the moment there is no way to do this packaging on non-Unix operating
 systems with a single script, e.g.
 a Windows 
\family typewriter
.bat
\family default
 script.
 However the steps themselves are trivial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
License and Contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer is published under the GPL, version 3 or later 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "stallman-gplv3"

\end_inset

.
 This basically means that you can modify the code and distribute the result
 as desired, as long as you publish your modifications under the same license.
 But consult a lawyer if you want an authoritative opinion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All contributions will be published under this same license, so if you send
 them this way you implicitly give your consent.
 An explicit license grant would be even better and may be required for
 larger contributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Future Extensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author has plans for the following extensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Templates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some header and footer content is automatically added to the resulting document.
 The use of templates might make the job far easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Postprocessors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some post-processing of the resulting HTML page could make the results look
 much better.
 The tool is called 
\family typewriter
posxer
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Page Segmentors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A page segmentor should build a set of pages and cross-reference them, but
 generally avoids the complexities of the internal structure.
 The tool is called 
\family typewriter
idxer
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tool uses templates to construct the header and footer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complete package should implement something like the flow in figure
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:pipeline"

\end_inset

.
 This is the high-level design that has to be filled in with the missing
 tools.

\begin_inset LatexCommand label

\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
MathML
\begin_inset LatexCommand label
name "sub:MathML"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As suggested by G√ºnther Milne and Abdelrazak Younes 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "milde-mathml,younes-elyxer"

\end_inset

, MathML is by now well supported in e.g.
 Firefox.
 An option to emit MathML (instead of more-or-less clumsy HTML and CSS code)
 would be very useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Roadmap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basic tool support should be ready in Q1 2009 (end of March), including
 support for most common LyX documents.
 In Q2 2009 (i.e.
 by the end of June) the pipeline should be complete and running.
 LyX integration (as an external tool) is planned for Q3 2009.
 All this is within the usual constraints: day job, family, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discarded Bits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not everything that has been planned or can be done with eLyXer is planned;
 some extensions have been discarded.
 However, this means basically that the author is too ignorant to know how
 to do them right; help (and patches!) towards a sane implementation would
 be welcome if they fit with the design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spellchecking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX can use a spellchecker to verify the words used.
 However it is not interactive so you may forget to run it before generating
 a version.
 It is possible to integrate eLyXer with a spellchecker and verify the spelling
 before generating the HTML, but it is not clear that it can be done cleanly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
URL Checking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another fun possibility is to make eLyXer check all the external URLs embedded
 in the document.
 However the Python facilities for URL checking are not very mature, at
 least with Python 2.5: some of them do not return errors, others throw complex
 exceptions that have to be parsed\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 It is far easier to just create the HTML
 page and use wget (or a similar tool) to recursively check all links in
 the page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Use of 
\family typewriter
lyx2lyx
\family default
 Framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Abdelrazak Younes suggests using the 
\family typewriter
lyx2lyx
\family default
 framework, which after all already knows about LyX formats 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "younes-elyxer"

\end_inset

.
 It is an interesting suggestion, but one that for now does not fit well
 with the design of eLyXer: a standalone tool to convert between two formats,
 or as Kernighan and Plauger put it, a standalone 
\emph on
filter
\emph default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "kernighan-filters"

\end_inset

.
 Long-term maintenance might result a bit heavier with this approach though,
 especially if LyX changes to a different file format in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
FAQ
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: I don't like how your tool outputs my document, what can I do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: First make sure that you are using the proper CSS file, i.e.
 copy the existing 
\family typewriter
docs/lyx.css
\family default
 file to your web page directory.
 Next try to customize the CSS file to your liking; it is a flexible approach
 that requires no code changes.
 Changing code should be a last resort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Why does your Python code suck so much? You don't make proper use of
 most features!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: Because I'm mostly a novice with little Python culture.
 If you want to help it suck less, please send mail and enlighten me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: How is the code maintained?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: It is kept in a 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
 repository.
 Patches in 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
 format are welcome (but keep in mind that my knowledge of 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
 is even shallower than my Python skills).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Why isn't the whole repository published?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: Basically, for lack of a hosting facility.
 Once a suitable place is found the 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
 repository will be published.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: I found a bug, what should I do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: Just report it to the author in a mail.
 In the future there might be some automated way to manage bugs.
