\begin_layout Title
eLyXer User Guide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\emph on
elixir, n: a substance believed to cure all ills
\emph default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
target "http://www.wordreference.com/definition/elixir"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer (pronounced the same as 
\emph on
elixir
\emph default
) converts a LyX document into a web page that you can publish on the net.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer can be invoked from the command line as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
$ elyxer.py [source file] [destination file]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the source file is omitted then 
\family typewriter
STDIN
\family default
 is used; likewise, if no destination file is specified eLyXer will output
 to 
\family typewriter
STDOUT
\family default
.
 This allows its use in pipes and other flexible configurations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
$ elyxer.py file.lyx file.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
converts 
\family typewriter
file.lyx
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
file.html
\family default
.
 Debug messages are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
$ cat file.lyx | elyxer.py > file.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
converts 
\family typewriter
file.lyx
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
file.html
\family default
, as before.
 This time debug messages are not shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
$ elyxer.py file.lyx | grep "<blockquote>" | wc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
counts all blockquote paragraphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Resources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer should be quite fast on contemporary hardware.
 On my 1st-gen Asus Eee (with its underpowered 800MHz Celeron processor
 -- underclocked to 570MHz), eLyXer can convert ~200 pages of LyX text in
 just over 6 seconds.
 Performance is fairly lineal: 200 pages take 
\begin_inset Formula $10\times$
\end_inset

 as long as 20, so there are no artificial bottlenecks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Memory usage stays low even when processing large documents, since conversion
 is done on the fly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Image Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If installed eLyXer will use the ImageMagick package (and more specifically
 the 
\family typewriter
convert
\family default
 tool) to create PNG versions of the images embedded in the document.
 If it is not installed -- well, right now eLyXer will fail.
 It should probably check.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Advanced Use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some advanced uses for eLyXer if you want to extract the most
 of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Appearance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HTML output, as generated, is a bit crude.
 Some CSS wizardry can go a long way to make eLyXer output look nicer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer tags most elements with the type so you can later modify them using
 a CSS.
 The HTML header reads like listing 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:CSS"

\end_inset

, so a CSS file 
\family typewriter
lyx.css
\family default
 is employed if found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float algorithm
wide false
sideways false
status open

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
<head>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
<title>Your title here</title>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
\series bold
<link rel="stylesheet" href="lyx.css" type="text/css" media="screen"/>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
</head>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Caption

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand label
name "alg:CSS"

\end_inset

CSS link automatically added to HTML
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sample CSS file is distributed along with the scripts, 
\family typewriter
docs/lyx.css
\family default
.
 To use it just copy it to the directory where your document resides, and
 customize as needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Postprocessing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another feature worth mentioning is the eLyXer postprocessor 
\family typewriter
posxer
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the moment the postprocessor is under construction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Segmenting pages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quite often you don't want a huge monolithic page, but a set of linked pages.
 At the moment eLyXer does not allow you to do that, but a planned extension
 will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complete flow of tools might look like the one in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:pipeline"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
wide false
sideways false
status open

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename /home/chenno/bulk/elyxer/docs/pipeline.eps

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Caption

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand label
name "fig:pipeline"

\end_inset

Complete eLyXer pipeline.
\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
Extending eLyXer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer does not at the moment support all LyX features; it will happily
 stop processing whenever it finds an unknown command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What can I do if eLyXer refuses to work with my LyX file? Worry not! Its
 flexible approach via containers, parsers and outputs allows anyone to
 write support for the missing command.
 eLyXer is written in Python so that it does not need to be compiled; its
 code is interpreted on the fly.
 It requires Python 2.5.x; at the moment there are no plans to migrate to
 Python 2.6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See the accompanying developer guide to learn how to extend eLyXer for your
 own purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
FAQ
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: What versions of LyX are supported?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: At the moment the tool is very limited; it basically works for the author's
 machine, i.e.
 LyX 1.5.5 on Debian lenny.
 With some help the author plans to add support for more recent LyX versions
 (1.6) and a more thorough set of documents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Why did you leave out my favorite feature 
\emph on
<insert random LyX command here>
\emph default
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: In short, because I wasn't using it.
 Usually it is better to first aim for your own needs and then worry about
 others, or you will never get anything done.
 But if you know how to program in Python it should not be difficult to
 support other LyX features.
 If you don't you can always ask the author; you can find him at the elyxer
 gmail account.
