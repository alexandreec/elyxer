\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer (pronounced 
\emph on
elixir
\emph default
) is a LyX to HTML converter.
 While there are a ton of such projects all over the web, eLyXer has a clear
 focus on flexibility and elegant output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer (including this guide and all accompanying materials) is licensed
 under the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "GPL version 3"
target "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html"

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 to find out about the latest developments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
System Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer requires Python 2.3.4, and should work with versions up to 2.6.
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

; it will convert documents generated by LyX 1.5.
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to 1.6.
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 It has been tested on the most common operating systems: on Mac OS X, Linux
 and Windows, with and without CygWin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Resource usage should be quite frugal; eLyXer runs quite happily on my 1st-gen
 Asus Eee, with its puny Celeron@570MHz and 512 MB of RAM.
 It should also be fast -- the Eee can convert ~200 pages of LyX text in
 just over 6 seconds.
 Performance is fairly linear: 200 pages take 
\begin_inset Formula $10\times$
\end_inset

 as long as 20, so there are no artificial bottlenecks.
 Memory usage stays low even when processing large documents, since conversion
 is done on the fly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Installation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to install eLyXer: the easy way and the elegant way.
 Both start by uncompressing the distributed file to a suitable directory.
 Just write at the command prompt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 tar -xzf elyxer-
\emph on
[version]
\emph default
.tar.gz
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or for the 
\family typewriter
.zip
\family default
 version:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 unzip elyxer-
\emph on
[version]
\emph default
.zip
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A directory called 
\family typewriter
elyxer
\family default
 should appear, where the main executable file 
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
 resides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Easy Way
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easy way to install is just using this file directly, preferably placing
 it in the execution path.
 To do this on Linux, type as root:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
#
\color inherit
 cp elyxer.py /usr/bin/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Windows you can type (as a normal user):
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
>
\color inherit
 copy elyxer.py c:
\backslash
Windows
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And on Mac OS X any user with administrative privileges (like the default
 user):
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
%
\color inherit
 sudo cp elyxer.py /usr/local/bin/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also put 
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
 on any other directory in your path, like 
\family typewriter
~/bin
\family default
, or even use an absolute path.
 In any instance you will be able to access 
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
 as an executable file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py --help
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
>
\color inherit
 elyxer.py --help
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
%
\color inherit
 elyxer.py --help
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Windows you may also call explicitly the Python executable, and locate
 the file 
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
 on your disk:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
>
\color inherit
 Python.exe "c:
\backslash
route to
\backslash
elyxer.py" --help
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last usage may be useful if you are having trouble with file paths
 that include spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Elegant Way
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The elegant (and not much more complicated) way of installing eLyXer is
 using Python distutils.
 Go to the 
\family typewriter
elyxer
\family default
 directory and type, as root:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
#
\color inherit
 python setup.py install
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once again, on Windows you don't have to be root:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
>
\color inherit
 python setup.py install
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Mac OS X you can use 
\family typewriter
sudo
\family default
 to have permission:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
%
\color inherit
 sudo python setup.py install
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you can run eLyXer as a Python module:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 python -m elyxer --help
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This procedure will also ensure that any Python packages trying to access
 eLyXer will find it.
 See 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:LyX-Integration"

\end_inset

 for LyX integration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From now on we will assume that you are running 
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
 as an executable file, but you should substitute that for 
\family typewriter
python -m elyxer
\family default
 if you have opted for this elegant procedure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Test Drive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you may want to try to convert the user guide:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py --css lyx.css --title "eLyXer User Guide" docs/userguide.lyx docs/usergu
ide2.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should generate a working web page identical to the one distributed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 diff docs/userguide.html docs/userguide2.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical output will contain just the changed lines, which in this case
 should be only the header with the file creation date.
 An example is shown on listing 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:diff"

\end_inset

.

\begin_inset LatexCommand label

\end_inset

Example of 
\family typewriter
diff
\family default
 output for functionally identical HTML files.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If nothing else appears (i.e.
 both files are functionally equal) then everything is working fine.
 If you have 
\family typewriter
bash
\family default
 installed, to test that everything 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 works fine you can just run the included tests:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 ./run-tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will run a number of test and check the results, so you can see if everything
 is well.
 You also need to have installed the command-line tool 
\family typewriter
diff
\family default
 to show differences between two files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer is a standalone command line tool.
 It can be invoked from the command line as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py [options] [source file] [destination file]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the source file is omitted then 
\family typewriter
STDIN
\family default
 is used; likewise, if no destination file is specified eLyXer will output
 to 
\family typewriter
STDOUT
\family default
.
 This allows its use in pipes and other flexible configurations.
 Some examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py file.lyx file.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
converts 
\family typewriter
file.lyx
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
file.html
\family default
.
 Debug messages are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 cat file.lyx | elyxer.py > file.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
converts 
\family typewriter
file.lyx
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
file.html
\family default
, as before.
 This time debug messages are not shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py file.lyx | grep "<blockquote>" | wc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
counts all blockquote paragraphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py file.lyx | wget --no-check-certificate --spider -nv -F -i -
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
checks all external links in a document recursively.
 (Local links will appear as unresolved, but they can be ignored.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Image Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HTML pages do not contain images, as PDF documents; rather they have pointers
 to image locations on disk.
 (Luckily LyX documents are the same in this respect.) eLyXer will generate
 pages that point to the same locations as the original images, when they
 are PNG images.
 Other image types like Encapsulated PostScript cannot be used directly
 from within pages.
 If the ImageMagick package is installed eLyXer will use the 
\family typewriter
convert
\family default
 tool to create PNG versions of the images embedded in the document.
 If it is not installed eLyXer will show an error message and will not try
 to convert further images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Image location is fragile.
 All images should be placed in the same location (and with the same structure)
 as the original document; and they should all be referenced relatively
 to the current document.
 During conversion from within LyX (in those versions where it is available)
 image locations can be lost.
 Your best bet is to do conversion in place.

LyX Integration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Integration of eLyXer within LyX requires a few steps that depend on your
 operating system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Unix/Linux: Make sure that the eLyXer program file (
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
) is in the execution path (e.g.
 
\family typewriter
/usr/bin
\family default
 on Linux).
 Now run LyX and click on Tools\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Reconfigure.
 HTML export should now run 
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Windows: Locate the directory where LyX was installed, and inside it the
 directory called 
\family typewriter
bin
\family default
.
 Now place the eLyXer program file (
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
) in the 
\family typewriter
bin
\family default
 directory, and run Tools\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Reconfigure.
 As before, HTML export should now run 
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Windows, the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url

\end_inset

 comes bundled with a version of eLyXer since 1.6.4.1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Advanced Use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some advanced uses for eLyXer if you want to extract the most
 of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Command Line Options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer supports a few command line optios.
 They are the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
--help
\family default
: show command line help.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter

\family default
: show debug messages.
 They may help a developer understand your problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter

HTML output, as generated, can be a bit crude.
 Some CSS wizardry can go a long way to make eLyXer output look nicer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer tags most elements with the type so you can later modify them using
 a CSS.
 The HTML header reads like listing 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:CSS"

\end_inset

, so the default remote CSS file is used.

This sample CSS file is published on nongnu.org and distributed along with
 the scripts, 
\family typewriter
docs/lyx.css
\family default
.
 (You may have found that your document changes its appearance with time
 -- this is the reason.
 The main author regularly publishes a new, updated version of 
\family typewriter
lyx.css
\family default
 on nongnu.org, and all documents using it automatically appear with the
 changes.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To give your document a customized appearance (or for pages to be accessible
 offline) you probably will want to use your own CSS file; to use it first
 copy it to the directory where your document resides (e.g.
 renaming it to 
\family typewriter
custom.css
\family default
), and customize as needed.
 Then run 
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
 with the following option:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py --css=custom.css document.lyx page.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will make the generated 
\family typewriter
page.html
\family default
 use your 
\family typewriter
custom.css
\family default
 file.
 The 
\family typewriter
`='
\family default
 sign between the constant 
\family typewriter
`--css'
\family default
 and the name of the CSS file is optional.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Title
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default the generated web pages have the title 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Converted Document
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If a PDF title is found then it is used instead.
 eLyXer does not try to use the proper LyX title, since it may be found
 in the middle of the document or not be present at all; scanning for it
 would mean doing two passes, one to look for the title in all the document
 and another to output the web page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can change the title of the web page (which is not the title of the
 document) with the 
\family typewriter
--title
\family default
 option:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py --title "My Beautiful Document" document.lyx page.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Table Of Contents
\begin_inset LatexCommand label
name "sub:TOC"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A table of contents (or TOC) can be generated for every converted LyX document.
 You can optionally also add a target frame to every link.
 The trick is to combine both options to generate a TOC that links to the
 original document on a different frame.
 For example, if the original page is called 
\family typewriter
page.html
\family default
 and you generated it with this command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py document.lyx page.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
you can generate the TOC linking to this page, and at the same time point
 it to frame 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py --toc page.html --target contents document.lyx page-toc.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then you can put it all together with a simple frameset generated manually.
 Just remember to place the original document in the frame called 
\family typewriter
contents
\family default
.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TOC generation accepts the same options as normal document conversion.
 For example, if you follow these instructions literally you will notice
 that the TOC has very wide margins and looks a bit weird; that is because
 it is using the default CSS.
 A special CSS file for TOC files is provided in 
\family typewriter
docs/toc.css
\family default
., so better results should be obtained with the 
\family typewriter
--css
\family default
 option:

With a little bit of practice you will be able to generate useful (and nice
 looking) TOC files.
 You can see an 
\begin_inset LatexCommand htmlurl
name "example for the user guide"
target "userguide-frameset.html"

\end_inset

 (if you are not already looking at it).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Segmenting Pages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quite often you don't want a huge monolithic page, but a set of linked pages.
 At the moment eLyXer does not allow you to do that, but a planned extension
 will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
HTML Code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The HTML code generated is technically XHTML Transitional, version 1.0 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "xhtml"

\end_inset

, using UTF-8 encoding.
 Some programs have (in this day and age) trouble importing XHTML, notably
 some popular word processors.
 To work around this problem and provide more flexible output in general
 you can output HTML 4.0:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py --html document.lyx page-to-import.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, technically the code generated is HTML 4.01 Transitional 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "html-401"

\end_inset

 using UTF-8 encoding.
 Both versions should pass the W3C tests 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "w3c-validator"

\end_inset

.
 If your particular web page doesn't pass the tests, then it is a bug and
 it will be treated as such.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CSS file for eLyXer uses some CSS2 features for math structures (fractions,
 arrays).
 This makes the output incompatible with older browsers; it requires Microsoft
 Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 3, Safari 3 or Chrome 1.
 Check the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "Math Showcase"
target "math.html"

\end_inset

 to see if your browser can render eLyXer output correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For better browser compatibility, medium mathematical spaces are substituted
 in the output with midspaces -- improving the output for some popular browsers.
 If you want your mathematical spaces back, just use the 
\family typewriter
--unicode
\family default
 option:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 elyxer.py --unicode document.lyx page-to-import.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "Math Showcase with Unicode"
target "math-unicode.html"

\end_inset

 to see the results.
 In the future other non-Unicode substitutions might be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Work in Progress
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you have already seen eLyXer is very much a work in progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Known Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following issues (including bugs and missing features) are acknowledged.
 Some of them should be solved soon; others may take longer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Document structure is not preserved for certain document categories: for
 example in articles sections start with a 
\family typewriter
<h2>
\family default
 element (when they should translate to 
\family typewriter
<h1>
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On Mac OS X the output of a message with Unicode characters may cause an
 error.
 Workaround: run 
\family typewriter
elyxer.py
\family default
 with the 
\family typewriter
--quiet
\family default
 option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Phonetic alphabet symbols are not supported -- if generated with LyX they
 appear with a weird command syntax: 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\textipa{[sample]}}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Standard
This happens only in the HTML file converted with eLyXer, not from within
 LyX.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Note Comment
status open

\begin_layout Standard
By the way, the previous note (and this one) should not appear on the HTML.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Vertical spacing is not preserved.
 (It is hard to do in CSS without significant mangling.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Multi-column layouts are lost.
 This one is almost impossible to get right in CSS, so there are no plans
 to even try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
BibTeX support is primitive.
 (Bear in mind that the minimalistic approach using templates can be improved,
 but it will never be perfect.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ERT (bare TeX code) is ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Images are lost during conversion from within LyX.
 We are working with LyX developers to solve the issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The table of contents (and lists of objects) are lost in translation.
 Since eLyXer is currently a single-pass converter, it cannot know beforehand
 what the document will contain.
 A second processing pass might be added in the future to address this issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Many AMS environments (like 
\family typewriter
alignat
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
gather
\family default
\SpecialChar \ldots{}
) are not working or look strange -- some non-AMS environments too.

\begin_layout Subsection
Extending eLyXer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer does not at the moment support all LyX features; sometimes it will
 ignore a command, sometimes it will signal it, and it might even refuse
 to work with certain documents.
 What can you do if eLyXer does not work with your LyX file? Worry not!
 Its flexible approach to processing allows anyone to write support for
 the missing commands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer is written in Python so that it does not need to be compiled; its
 code is interpreted on the fly.
 See the accompanying 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
name "developer guide"
target "devguide.html"

\end_inset

 to learn how to extend eLyXer for your own purposes.
 If you know how to program in Python it should not be difficult to support
 other LyX features.
 If you don't your best bet is to ask the author.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
FAQ
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: What versions of LyX are supported?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: The tool is slowly improving; it now should work with LyX versions 1.5.5
 to 1.6.2.
 It has been tested on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: What can we expect from the tool in the future?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: eLyXer should support a widening set of LyX features, and a couple of
 tricks of its own (such as page segmenting).
 Eventually it should be recognized LyX so that it can be accessed from
 within the editor.
 Joint distribution is also a possibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Why did you leave out my favorite feature 
\emph on
<insert random LyX command here>
\emph default
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: In short, because I wasn't using it.
 Usually it is better to first aim for your own needs and then worry about
 others, or you will never get anything done.
 But if you let me know I will be glad to help.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: My document changed its appearance without my intervention.
 Was it black magic, elves or what?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: It probably uses the online CSS file, which is regularly updated.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:CSS"

\end_inset

 for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Why use an online CSS, instead of placing the CSS file in the same directory
 as the converted file?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: There were pros and cons.
 An online CSS resource allowed me to update it for everyone at the same
 time, but might make it more difficult for people without an internet connectio
n; local CSS files are more flexible but can also be confusing to novice
 users.
 In the end the online solution was preferred, with the 
\family typewriter
--css
\family default
 option as a fallback.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: I found a bug, what should I do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: Just send it to the author at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url

target "mailto:elyxer@gmail.com"

\end_inset

.
 You can also report it to the Savannah interface: 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url
